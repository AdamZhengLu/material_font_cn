==========

Here are three newly developed CN fonts, which also support some special characters.

①JYRB.ttf (吉页燃爆体) .

② MZSY.ttf (喵字摄影体) .

③ YZGGPB .ttf (也字工厂电影旁白体) .

In my daily work environment, I edit files using VIM / VS Code tools. So I need one beautiful font in Chinese.

In windows system, there are some original fonts are beautiful, for example "Yahei", but they can't support some English characters.

I get "JYRB", "MZSY" and "YZGGPB" from web. Here is the address: [Zhaozi.cn](https://www.zhaozi.cn/)

They are tiny and beautiful thus I add these characters by myself and share them.
